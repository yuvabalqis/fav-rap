            <h2>LYRICS</h2>
           <br> Um, it's a good time to say "Holy smokes"
           <br>
 <br>You know it's Schemaboys to the motherfucking grave, bitch
<br>Sxmpra stay the same, and you know I never take shit
<br>
<br>I don't talk about it, I just spit and let the bass hit
<br>You don't really wanna be the one to have to run up, turn and face it
<br>Pussy motherfucker really wanna be the one to pull up on a brother
<br>Wait a minute, better stand back
<br>I'ma be the one to get a motherfucker jumpin' to the bass
<br>Let it rip so quick, who that?
<br>Do it alone, now gimme the bone, I'm takin' 'em on
<br>When I pop off, let 'em fall flat
<br>Let-let a man swing with a baseball bat
<br>I don't need that, motherfucker, who mad?
<br>Comin' from the underground, ain't losin' the sound
<br>I'm tryna make my brothers proud, you know I'm doin' it now
<br>These other rappers can't compete, they fuckin' hate when they down
<br>I came from nothin', now they just can't keep my name out they mouth
<br>
<br>They don't really fuck with the ones like us
<br>And they gon' see us as a threat 'til we overcome
<br>We tell 'em "Boy, you out of luck
<br>'Cause the the clock has struck
<br>And we gon' come to take the throne
<br>Man, yo' time is up"
<br>They don't really fuck with the ones like us
<br>And they gon' see us as a threat 'til we overcome
<br>We tell 'em "Boy, you out of luck
<br>'Cause the the clock has struck
<br>And we gon' come to take the throne
<br>Man, yo' time is up"
<br>
<br>They don't really fuck with the ones like us
<br>I don't really fuck with the ones like them
<br>Put 'em in a grave, bitch, eat my dust
<br>Never gonna get away, bitch, where's my pen?
<br>Writing down these lyrics, I'm igniting the paper
<br>I guess it's safer to type 'em, I got the gods in my favor
<br>'Cause I'm a cowbell warrior, boy, we ain't the same
<br>You ain't spit the shit like this, I guess I drive 'em insane, ayy
<br>Wait a minute, motherfucker really wanna buck up with a brother
<br>Gotta put 'em in the gutter with the other motherfucker that tried to test my team
<br>I guess I need to let 'em free
<br>I'ma be what I've been, stay the same until I D-I-E
<br>I'll rest in peace knowin' that I fuckin' backed my team
